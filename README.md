# Personal Resume & HTML Practice

This repo helps me learn front-end basics (HTML/CSS/JS) through two simple
examples:

- `index.html` – my DevOps resume laid out as a single-page site. It links to
  `styles.css` for layout/typography and `scripts.js` for interactivity.
- `table_styling.html` – a tiny practice file that focuses on table semantics
  (`caption`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tfoot`) so I can experiment with table styling.

## Practice Log

- Added a horizontal navigation bar to `index.html` using a styled `<ul>` list.
- Converted the practice table into a meaningful “Skills Matrix” section.

## How to Run

1. Open either HTML file with Live Server (VS Code extension) or by dragging it
   into a browser.
2. Update `styles.css` to try new layouts, spacing, fonts, etc.
<!-- 3. Use `scripts.js` to prototype JavaScript behavior (e.g., expand/collapse
   sections, highlight timeline entries). -->
