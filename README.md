# Online Resume form course (PA 307.4.1) 

This folder is a self-contained copy of my HTML/CSS resume project. Everything is plain markup and styles so I can open it directly in a browser 

## Folder Structure

- `html/index.html` –  The main resume page with three sections (profile, employment/education, skills).
- `css/styles.css` – A single stylesheet for the resume layout and responsive tweaks.
- `assets/images/` – headshot, contact icons, and the original wireframe screenshot.
- `README.md` – this overview plus resource links where i looked up 

## How to View

1. Open the `online-resume` folder in VS Code Live Server
2. Resize the browser to see the desktop vs. mobile layout.

## Notes

- Sections are wrapped in semantic tags with small HTML comments so it is easy to tweak.
- Skill bars are simple `div` elements with inline widths to keep the math transparent.
- All colors, spacing, and responsive rules live near the top of `css/styles.css`.
